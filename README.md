# Overview
If you are getting an "App keeps stopping" error when you open your app in Android, then this copy of React Native's default android folder may fix this problem for you.

# Fix
1. Copy /android to the main directory of your project
2. Set the package/applicationId of your app android/app/build.gradle(line 101)
	- If you haven't changed it manually it should be com.<project-folder-name>

# Additional information
 - /android is a copy of the contents generated by React Native CLI with some of the files/folders removed.
 - This fix was tested on ReactXP 1.6.0-rc.1, with the latest android-sdk, buildTools(28.0.3) and supportLib(28.0.0) installed(28.02.2019)
